Review
Helpful for the beginners who are starting data visualization or R-Course But not so much for advanced studies or projects. Good Cover and Fine Printing with smooth pages.Overall Worth the money but only for beginners.
Book cover and paper quality is okay. Package is good. Buy only if u have R basic knowledge.
"Firstly understand that this book does not cover most of models, algorithms etc. It actually covers all the steps that you need to perform on ""real life"" data to get it ready to run your models. It does not teach about K-means, regression, bagging and boosting etc. For that you can use James,Witten,Hastie,Tibshirani's excellent ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" book. But this Wikham book fills a critical void.In my personal experience it takes more than 90% time to get the data in a shape where you think it is now ready for you to run your algorithms. This is far cry from the sterile,cleaned up  data sets used in the data science courses. The real life data is very messy. This book is clearly written for the practitioners who deal with real life situations. This book helped me a lot to get my data in proper form. which includes joining two disparate data-sets based on keys,  creating new derivative columns based on existing columns, remove unwanted feature set, take care of all those NAs, filter the rows on criteria, perform different aggregate functions (mean, sum, median etc) date wise or factor wise. It also covers bit of ggplot basics so you can start plotting the data from the word go. This book uses the tidyverse family packages (especially dplyr) written by the same author. ggplot is also written by Wikham. Both packages contain functions that can improve your productivity 10x. Both have now become  de facto packages used by most R data scientists.This book immensely helped me perform data analysis on my messy data. It taught me what and how to perform necessary operations on my data using very useful functions in dplyr package which is part of tidyverse family.R is very powerful environment for data analysis. I would call it Ferrari of data science world. But although very powerful, it has its own quirks and learning curve, even for experienced programmers. The packages like dplyr, caret, ggplot make your life easier and allow you to fully harness the horse power of R."
"The author has taken a good approach.  Instead of giving you the introduction or much theory, author teaches each concept with examples.  You start with coding immediately which actually better.  Exercise is also very good.Those who have just started R just like me, I highly recommend it.  You will be fully engaged with coding and not get bored."
Go for it. learn it
"It is hard to pick a good introductory data science book these days since there are too many out there. But R for Data Science is arguably one of the best books you can pick and start your data science journey. If you go through this whole book, not only you will learn fundamentals of data science but also advanced data management tools that will allow you to analyze a variety of data. Some introduction to R language is required which can be picked up from first few chapters of Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff."
"Wonderful book for beginners. R programming is entirely new for me , this book full fills my needs, very good , easy to understand with examples and exercises  for practice perfect The condition of the book looks kind of old , the front cover is not good."
Good for the price.
It is really helpful to have it by your side no matter how proficient in R you are.
Really good book to learn the ropes in R... must haves for anyone just starting off with R... It's structured and has good amount of practice questions

Some introduction to R language is required which can be picked up from first few chapters of Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff."
"Wonderful book for beginners. R programming is entirely new for me , this book full fills my needs, very good , easy to understand with examples and exercises  for practice perfect The condition of the book looks kind of old , the front cover is not good."
Good for the price.
It is really helpful to have it by your side no matter how proficient in R you are.
Really good book to learn the ropes in R... must haves for anyone just starting off with R... It's structured and has good amount of practice questions
Helpful for the beginners who are starting data visualization or R-Course But not so much for advanced studies or projects. Good Cover and Fine Printing with smooth pages.Overall Worth the money but only for beginners.
Book cover and paper quality is okay. Package is good. Buy only if u have R basic knowledge.
"Firstly understand that this book does not cover most of models, algorithms etc. It actually covers all the steps that you need to perform on ""real life"" data to get it ready to run your models. It does not teach about K-means, regression, bagging and boosting etc. For that you can use James,Witten,Hastie,Tibshirani's excellent ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" book. But this Wikham book fills a critical void.In my personal experience it takes more than 90% time to get the data in a shape where you think it is now ready for you to run your algorithms. This is far cry from the sterile,cleaned up  data sets used in the data science courses. The real life data is very messy. This book is clearly written for the practitioners who deal with real life situations. This book helped me a lot to get my data in proper form. which includes joining two disparate data-sets based on keys,  creating new derivative columns based on existing columns, remove unwanted feature set, take care of all those NAs, filter the rows on criteria, perform different aggregate functions (mean, sum, median etc) date wise or factor wise. It also covers bit of ggplot basics so you can start plotting the data from the word go. This book uses the tidyverse family packages (especially dplyr) written by the same author. ggplot is also written by Wikham. Both packages contain functions that can improve your productivity 10x. Both have now become  de facto packages used by most R data scientists.This book immensely helped me perform data analysis on my messy data. It taught me what and how to perform necessary operations on my data using very useful functions in dplyr package which is part of tidyverse family.R is very powerful environment for data analysis. I would call it Ferrari of data science world. But although very powerful, it has its own quirks and learning curve, even for experienced programmers. The packages like dplyr, caret, ggplot make your life easier and allow you to fully harness the horse power of R."
"The author has taken a good approach.  Instead of giving you the introduction or much theory, author teaches each concept with examples.  You start with coding immediately which actually better.  Exercise is also very good.Those who have just started R just like me, I highly recommend it.  You will be fully engaged with coding and not get bored."
Go for it. learn it

The packages like dplyr, caret, ggplot make your life easier and allow you to fully harness the horse power of R."
"The author has taken a good approach.  Instead of giving you the introduction or much theory, author teaches each concept with examples.  You start with coding immediately which actually better.  Exercise is also very good.Those who have just started R just like me, I highly recommend it.  You will be fully engaged with coding and not get bored."
Go for it. learn it
"It is hard to pick a good introductory data science book these days since there are too many out there. But R for Data Science is arguably one of the best books you can pick and start your data science journey. If you go through this whole book, not only you will learn fundamentals of data science but also advanced data management tools that will allow you to analyze a variety of data. Some introduction to R language is required which can be picked up from first few chapters of Art of R Programming by Norman Matloff."
"Wonderful book for beginners. R programming is entirely new for me , this book full fills my needs, very good , easy to understand with examples and exercises  for practice perfect The condition of the book looks kind of old , the front cover is not good."
Good for the price.
It is really helpful to have it by your side no matter how proficient in R you are.
Really good book to learn the ropes in R... must haves for anyone just starting off with R... It's structured and has good amount of practice questions
